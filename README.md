### Data Animate

## Workload
This is an individual project, so I don't work with anyone else. 

Even though I only intended this project to be a prototype, the amount of code required for this protoype is still immense. I regularly spend 6 to 10 hours on this project every single day.The entire process takes about 100 hours of work, excluding time spent on the paper and the poster. 

## Working process
The development process wasn't smooth. It's quite difficult to build a large web application, and it's tricky to get D3 and React to work together. Furthermore, along the way, I have to make a lot of trade-offs. I don't intend this to be a software developement project, so I had to decide on the visualizations that I want to so and work on them, and what I really wanted to demonstrate. At the same time, I don't want to hardcode every single thing, so I invested quite a bit of time to develop the underlying application. 

## What I learned along the way
During the development of the project, I learned quite a few new technologies, and I also got a much deeper understanding of how D3 and D3 transition works. Using the prototype, I get to evaluate the value of my idea, and whether this idea is actually feasible.
